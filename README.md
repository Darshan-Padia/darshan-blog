- **Single Post Page**: Renders the full content of a post, including images and markdown formatting, along with related posts, author information, and a comment section.
- **Category Filtering**: Ability to filter posts by category.
- **Comment Submission and Moderation**: Users can submit comments on posts, which go through a moderation process before being displayed.
- **Pagination**: The blog posts are paginated for better performance and user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a mobile-first approach and is responsive across different screen sizes.
